# Practice 3: Wine Quality Data Classification/Regression/Clustering Practice

This directory provides practice examples for supervised learning (classification/regression), unsupervised learning (clustering), and visualization using the wine quality dataset.

## Example Files
- `wine_quality.py`: Quality grade classification using RandomForest, quality score prediction using LinearRegression, clustering with KMeans, scatter plot visualization

<br/>

## Execution Method

1. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run examples
```bash
python3 wine_quality.py
```

<br/>

## Main Contents
- **Supervised Learning**: Quality grade classification using RandomForest, quality score prediction using LinearRegression
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Wine data clustering using KMeans
- **Visualization**: Alcohol-acidity-quality scatter plot, clustering result visualization

<br/>

## Notes
- You can extend with various classification/regression/clustering algorithms and visualization methods.
